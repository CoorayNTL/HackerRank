/*Write the following code in your editor below:

A class named Arithmetic with a method named add that takes  integers as parameters and returns an integer denoting their sum.
A class named Adder that inherits from a superclass named Arithmetic.
Your classes should not be be .

Input Format

You are not responsible for reading any input from stdin; a locked code stub will test your submission by calling the add method on an Adder object and passing it  integer parameters.

Output Format

You are not responsible for printing anything to stdout. Your add method must return the sum of its parameters.

Sample Output

The main method in the Solution class above should print the following:

My superclass is: Arithmetic
42 13 20 */

class Atrithematic {
    public Atrithematic() {
    };
}

    private int num;
    private int num2;

    public Adder() {
        this.num = 0;

        this.name = "";
    }

    public int add(int num, int num2) {
        return num + num2;
    }

}

public class Q26 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a new Adder object
        Adder a = new Adder();

        // Print the name of the superclass on a new line
        System.out.println("My superclass is: " + a.getClass().getSuperclass().getName());

        // Print the result of 3 calls to Adder's `add(int,int)` method as 3
        // space-separated integers:
        System.out.print(a.add(10, 32) + " " + a.add(10, 3) + " " + a.add(10, 10) + "\n");
